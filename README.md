# Pecunia

Pecunia is a crypto wallet that focuses on making crypto more accessible to everyday users. It enables users to send/receive crypto with low fees, and carry out other kinds of transactions like split payments, fundraisers and recurring payments (subscriptions).

## Motivation and Goals

Currently, the adoption of crypto is hindered by the technical barrier-to-entry. Most wallets create a new paradigm, that appeals only to users who have some knowledge about the inner workings of the underlying technology. Pecunia's aim is to have a simple user experience, that's also as similar to existing mobile banking applications as possible.

In the future, Pecunia hopes to take this goal further by allowing users to perform contactless payments.

## Architecture & Design

By design, all transactions on Pecunia take place on the [Optimism](https://optimism.io) L2, and potentially other L2s in the future (before "The Merge"). This is to ensure that fees remain low, as Pecunia is a utility wallet.

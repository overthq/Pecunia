# Pecunia

Pecunia is an app that focuses on making crypto more accessible to everyday users.

## Motivation and Goals

Currently, the adoption of crypto is hindered by the technical barrier-to-entry. Most wallets create a new paradigm, that appeals only to users who have some knowledge about the inner workings of the underlying technology. Pecunia's aim is to have a simple user experience, that's also as similar to existing mobile banking applications as possible.

## Architecture & Design

Pecunia connects to your existing wallets using [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org), and enables you to carry out actions using the connected wallets. We do not store any of your private keys, and require explicit permission from your wallet application to carry out any transaction. As this code is also open source, you can verify these claims.
